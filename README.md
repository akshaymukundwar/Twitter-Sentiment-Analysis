# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Objective:- Here, we are trying to classify sentiment of the tweets i.e. whether the given tweet is Positive, Negative and Neutral. We are trying to check the sentiments of public towards Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi.

Overview:- Tweets are imported using tweepy library in python from Twitter API and the data is cleaned by removing emoticons and URLs. 
TextBlob and VaderSentiment are used for assigning the polarity to tweets. The opinion are expressed graphically through Pie Chart and Word Cloud. 
Then we build Naive Bayes, Random Forest and SVM models to predict the sentiment of tweets.

The code for the same is in script.py file and for detail information about the project go through project report.pdf
